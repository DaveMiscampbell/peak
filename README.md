peek
===============

Finally!  A framework for efficiently developing Tumblr themes.

### Why should you care?
To quote [@jenius](https://github.com/carrot/carrot-the-company/blob/master/ideas/tumblr-parser.md):

> Tumblr development at the moment is severely painful - you have to write the code without the tumblr tags, then paste it into tumblr to test. Their online text editor is slower, more awkward, and doesn't have the version control and text editing shortcuts we know, love, and rely on.

My answer is **peek**, a development framework for Tumblr themes.


### Installation

```
$ npm install peek -g
```

### Usage

```
$ touch my-tumblr-theme.sneak
$ peek my-tumblr-theme.sneak -t carrotcreative
```
